Interactive Binary Search Tree Visualization

Project Description:
Create a web-based interactive demo that allows users to visualize the operations and properties of a Binary Search Tree. Users should be able to perform basic BST operations like insertion, deletion, and search. The visualization should dynamically update to show the changes in the tree structure as these operations are performed.

Features:

Tree Visualization: Display the Binary Search Tree on the screen using a graphical representation. Each node should be labeled with its value.

Insertion: Allow users to insert new nodes into the BST. After insertion, the visualization should update to show the new node's position in the tree.

Deletion: Enable users to remove nodes from the BST. When a node is deleted, the visualization should reflect the updated tree structure.

Search: Implement a search functionality that highlights the path followed during the search operation. This can help users understand how the binary search property works.

Balancing: Implement a button that automatically balances the tree. You can choose a balancing algorithm like AVL or Red-Black trees and show how the tree is transformed to maintain balance.

Traversal: Include options for in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals. Highlight nodes as they are visited during the traversal.

Random Generation: Provide a feature to generate a random Binary Search Tree, allowing users to observe the effects of various operations on different tree structures.

Step-by-Step Mode: Offer a step-by-step mode that lets users perform each operation one step at a time, pausing to explain what's happening at each stage.

Animations: Add animations to the operations so that users can see nodes moving and rearranging as operations are performed.

Technologies:

HTML/CSS: For creating the user interface and styling the visualization.
JavaScript: To implement the Binary Search Tree logic, user interactions, and animations.
Canvas or SVG: Use either HTML5 Canvas or SVG for drawing and updating the tree visualization.
